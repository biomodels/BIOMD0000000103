## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000103.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000103.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000103 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes


This model represents the non-competitive binding of XIAP to Casapase-3 and
Caspase-9. In other words, XIAP mediated feedback is abolished in this model.
The authors state that this leads to bistable-reversible behaviour as depicted
in Fig 4C. The wild-type model displays a bistable-irreversible profile. This
shows that irreversibility requires XIAP mediated feedback. The model was
tested on MathSBML. However, please note that the paper does not contain any
figure that corresponds to simulation of the Non-Competitive model.
